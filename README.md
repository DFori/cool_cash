# cool_cash
This project is currently incomplete due to the fact that I Daniel Fori and
two of my colleaguesfell seriously ill.

The only part of this project that is done here is one page of the front end,
and due to a lack of communication we were unable to finish the project
the way we wanted to.
So we did another one that is less flashy but clean and perfectly
functional but we willsend you pictures of both projects,
incase that would incure your favor on the marks distribution

above is the home page of the incomplete project you can really feel the cool cash
with our logo (dollar sign with ice cubes beside it

and below is the new and slightly rushed but fully functional project
